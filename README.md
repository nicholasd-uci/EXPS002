# EXPS002

## About

```
    - We take a deeper dive within Express 
    - We learn what servers can do and their role in web development
    - Comprehensive view on server's being routes
    - Using Restful Routing Syntax
```
## Simple Test: Query vs Params

- Before we introduce the entire boiler plate template lets break it down first
- In these two example's we will cover Query's & Params
- Query's are ID within the Req and Res only
- Params are ID both within the URL and Req/Res

***Examples of a Query***

 ‣ Here is the VS Code

 ‣ Here is the example in Postman

***Example of a Param***

## Server Side Boiler Plate

    ‣ DON"T BOTHER REMEMBERING THIS! 
    ‣ Server-side boiler plate is just like an HTML boiler Plate
    ‣ Certain parts of the boiler plate help you connect F.E. to B.E.
